      DAY2 TASK:
1.List 5 difference between  browser JS  vs  Nodejs
                    BROWSER JS:
 (i)."window" is a p[redefined global object which has functions and attributes,that have to deal with window that has been drawn.
(ii)."location" is another predefined object in browsers,that has all the information about  the url we have loaded.
(iii)."document",which is also another predefined global variable in browsers,has the hyml which is rendered.
(iv).Browsers may have an object named "global",but it will be the exact one as"window".
(v).Browsers don't have "require" predefined.You may include it in your app for asynchronous file loading.
     
                NODE JS:
(i).Node doesn't have a predefined "window" object cause it doesn't have a window to draw anything.
(ii)."location" object is related to a particular url;that means it is for page specific.so,node doesn't require that.
(iii).Ofcourse node doesn't have "document"  object also,cause it never have to render anything in a page.
(iv).Node has "global",which is a predefined global object.It contains several functions that are not available in browsers,cause they are needed for
      server side wirks only.
(v)."require" object is predefined in Node which is used to include modules in the app


2.Watch and summary 5 points:
1.PARSING HTML =
  *html is a forgiving by nature.
  *parsing isn't straight forward.
   *can behalted.
2.Speculative parsing:
*will look ahead.
*external images,scripts.
3.Reentrant
*means  the parsing process can be intruptted
4.<script/>:at the bottom
*parse uninterrupted
*faster to render.
*trade off
5.DOM node to render object
*visual output
*can layout and paint.
