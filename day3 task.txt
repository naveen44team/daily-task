3.Read about the difference between window, screen and document in javascript:-

Window -window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window.

Screen- It is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.

Document - It is the main object of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM.
